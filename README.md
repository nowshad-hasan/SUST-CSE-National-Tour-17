# SUST-CSE-National-Tour-'17
It is a chrome extension to count the remaining time of our **SUST CSE National Tour in 2017**.

## Overview
_SUST CSE National Tour_ is the most exciting tour in _Computer Science & Engineering Department_ at
**Shahjalal University of Science & Technology (SUST)**. We, _SUST CSE'12_ batch arranged a tour in 2017 at 
**Cox's Bazar-Saint Martin**. Everyone was so excited about the tour that students always were thinking when 
_The Ultimate Moment_ would come. So, one of my classmates, **Mahmudun Nobi Kakon** made a static HTML page showing
the remaining days, hours, minutes, seconds and host it in https://pages.github.com/. The **_Template_** was taken
from https://github.com/technext. But I wanted it more functional in daily to daily usage. I linked it to `new tab` of the 
**Chrome Browser** making an extension. Every time anyone opens a 
`new tab`, it shows him the nice interface with remaining time from our _`Dream Tour`_.

It was my first **Chrome Extension**. Maybe it was a simple work but I really enjoyed making the project.
